                        <p> I've made my home base in Providence, Rhode Island, with my small growing family. My journey into tech started with a degree in journalism. As I started sharing my writing online, I was facinated with how easily I could get my voice out there. I was hooked and wanted to learn how to build my own site to fit my own specific needs.
                        </p>
                    </div>
                    <div class="half-width">
                        <p> That curiosity then opened a door that could never be shut. When I learned how to build my first website, I realized I found something that gave me the freedom & versitility I was looking for in my work. Now I've made a full switch to front-end development, where I can use my organization skills and eye for detail to write clean, elegant code.
